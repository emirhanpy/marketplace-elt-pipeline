I have extracted mobile phone data specifically from the Trendyol Marketplace and saved it in CSV format. After that, I continued with the transformation process, where I faced some challenges while trying to change data types. Additionally, I transformed the data into a more readable and understandable format and saved it as a new CSV file. I then created dashboards using SQLite3 to retrieve valuable information about brands, products, prices, ratings, favorites, and rating scores. During this project, I utilized several Python libraries, such as pandas, sqlite3, seaborn, matplotlib, airflow, and datetime.
